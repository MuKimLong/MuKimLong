### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Muhammet Uzun

I am an AI / Data Scientist

I can troubleshoot in an end-to-end data science cycle. 

This means I can take data problems from initial problem definition, through data processing, analysis leading to meaningful insights, dashboard creation, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence model training, up to deployment and presentation of results and translation into a product. 

I use my knowledge and skills in **Python** and its libraries, **SQL**, **Tableau** and **AWS technologies** to work on these processes. 

I have had a long and strong education including classes such as **NLP**, **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning**, **SQL**, **Python**, **Tableau**, **Git**, **Agile Methodogies**, **Linux**, among others. I believe I have built a solid theoretical foundation. In addition, since the first days of my adventure, I have embarked on many projects in various branches of my field to increase my competence. And I continue my process with appetite. 

I wanted to present the work I have done so far by classifying a few repostroies as follows. 

The first one contains my study notes and projects in the first year of my career in this field. I'm calling it 'First Attempt' for familiarity's sake. In it you will find things like;

-More than 20 big and small projects and very valuable study notebooks. These notebooks are organized topic by topic and contain the notes I took and links to the related topics.
-These are covering areas such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization with Python, as well as SQL, Tableau, and their subdomains.
-To be more specific, within this repository, you'll find a variety of Python libraries, ML models, approaches, and studies on deploying them.

**E-Commerce Projects**:

I established the second repository to house Machine Learning and AI projects tailored for the benefit of e-commerce companies. These projects encompass a spectrum of topics, including 
-Recommendation System Improvement, 
-Customer Churn Prediction, 
-Price Optimization, 
-Inventory Management, 
-Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Customer Feedback, 
-Image Recognition for Visual Search, 
-Shopping Cart Abandonment Analysis, 
-Fraud Detection, 
-A/B Testing, and 
-Conversion Rate Optimization, as well as Customer Segmentation.
In these project endeavors, I endeavored to tackle problems from diverse perspectives. More comprehensive explanations can be found within the project sections in the repository. As an illustration, the Recommendation System Enhancement project incorporates Book, Movie, and Article Recommendation sub-projects. Within these, I focused on enhancing diversity through various scenarios such as Cold Start Recommendation, Real-time Recommendation, Diversity, and Serendipity Enhancement.

**Computer Vision Projects**:

I really enjoy working on computer vision things. Although it was not included in the official training I received, I devoted time to this field and worked on it. I would really enjoy delving deeper into Computer Vision.

I have compiled a few studies I have done on this subject in this repository.

First of all, I would like to introduce a classic CNN classification project. Because this is a Pneumonia Detection model that I made for a doctor friend in Chile, which gave me great pleasure. You can also find the Streamlit codes I used to deploy this project. At the same time, I will also put the Lung Cancer Detection and Detection of Sick Leaves projects, which I also classified as CNN, in the same folder.
In addition, the Real-Time Vehicle Tracking AI application I made using NVIDIA's DeepStream and TAO Toolkit,
-Sign Language Action Detection,
-Lip Read,
-Face Detection,
-Pose Estimation,
-Volume Control with Fingers,
-Face Mash projects will also be included in this repository.

It will give me pleasure to deepen in any area of my field. Please do not hesitate to contact me for anything you think will benefit each other, the company, humanity or the universe
